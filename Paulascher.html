<h3 id="Intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Paula Scher, the unpopular <i>“art nut”</i> who grew to become one of the most famous graphic designers in the world. In this essay, I will discuss Paula Scher’s contribution to graphic design and typography.</p>
              
<h3 id="Early Life">Early Life</h3>
<p>Paula Scher was born on October 6th, 1948, in Washington D.C and grew up to become an artist contrary to the career paths chosen by her parents. Paula’s father was a photo-grammetric engineer and inventor, working for the government, her mother was a school teacher and her brother grew up to work for the government in the field of science. Then there was Paula, the <i>“art nut”</i> which she now describes herself as. Paula had individual preferences and quirks that were different from other people and she had a tendency to hide them in order to better fit into her social context.</p>
    
    <blockquote>"As a child, I wanted to be a singer, dancer, piano-player and bare back rider. When I got older and realized I wasn’t a beauty, I decided I wanted to be an artist. I didn’t know what a designer was – yet.” - Paula Scher</blockquote>
    
<h3 id="Education">Education</h3>
<p>Eventually, Paula went off to college to study illustration and even though her parents were not very supportive, she found herself in a company of like-minded people.</p>

<p>Studying in the 1960’s felt comfortable to Paula and if there is one thing that stayed with her throughout all social and political movements of the time is that she really hangs onto the notion of being an individual. This goes back to the suburban experience of her growing up. 
As an example, Paula thinks that if you use Facebook, it controls your behaviour in a way that you are supposed to like, comment and share everything. According to her, that is not good for society.</p>
    
<p>Paula had several teachers whom she owes a lot to but there is one college professor in particular who left an impression on her. It was in her first graphic design course, called basic design. Paula’s teacher, Stanislaw Zagorski, taught the Bauhaus method of learning to see space, in which, as an example, one moves black squares around white pages. Paula was sloppy in that class because she was terrible at crafts and drawing but she was good at thinking and was aesthetically sensible. As a response to that, Paula’s professor told her to illustrate using typography, and eventually she began to understand how to integrate words and images in a powerful way. Paula fell in love with it, and soon the images disappeared and she became a typographer.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“Typography is painting with words” – Paula Scher</blockquote>
    
<h3 id="Career">Career</h3>
<p>Having earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1970, Paula landed a job in New York at CBS Records in 1972. After working for both CBS Records and Atlantic Records, Paula became the art director for both companies. She also designed over one hundred and fifty album covers a year and was nominated for four Grammy Awards during the eight years working for CBS Records. Some of the more iconic album covers include <i>“The Ultimate Album Cover Album” (1977)</i> and <i>“Sakura: Japanese Melodies for Flute and Harp” (1978)</i> which are both influenced by Japanese culture. <i>“Bartók” (1978)</i> is in the classical genre with its Contemporary, Modern and Neo-Romantic-style. These are some of the more significant Paula Scher’s contributions to graphic design because they involve reviving design styles and historical typefaces.</p>

<p>In 1982, Paula left Atlantic Records and co-founded the studio Koppel & Scher with fellow University graduate Terry Koppel where she embraced the hard work of producing brand identities, packaging, and advertisement. She also designed the well-known Swatch poster from 1984 which was copied from the original <i>“Schweiz”</i>poster by Herbert Matter.</p>

<p>Having worked together for seven years, during a period of recession, Koppel quit the partnership and took a working position at Esquire magazine. Paula continued to work in their studio for a year until she accepted a partner position at the world-famous design firm, Pentagram, New York, becoming the first female who has ever done so.</p>
    
<p>In 1992, one year after Paula entered partnership with Pentagram, she became an educator, teaching at School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York. By then, Paula had earned a great reputation and won more than three hundred awards from international design associations. She is also known for her big scale maps and designs which will be further discussed in this essay.</p>
    
<h3 id="Brand Identity Systems">Brand Identity Systems</h3>
<p>Paula Scher has executed some of the most successful brand identity systems in the world, but first, what is a Brand Identity System?
A Brand Identity System, short for BIS is a collection of elements within a brand which work together to create more consistent and efficient brand assets to communicate its value to the audience effectively.</p>

<p>Paula’s secret on how to create a successful visual system lies in the relation of designing identities which involves components that are collectively recognizable. 
Let’s put it this way. Brand Identity Systems change over time, and if you consider the Paul Rand era, he would for example make a perfect mark in the corner of a box, and if that corner was ripped off, then you would have no idea which company that box belonged to.</p>
    
<p>Paula’s secret on how to create a successful visual system lies in the relation of designing identities which involves components that are collectively recognizable. 
Let’s put it this way. Brand Identity Systems change over time, and if you consider the Paul Rand era, he would for example make a perfect mark in the corner of a box, and if that corner was ripped off, then you would have no idea which company that box belonged to.
Therefore, designing identities today involves components that are collectively recognizable.
This can be everything from a logo type to a particular colour palette. Ideally, you want to use the identity system in every form of media so it is small yet holds great capacity. In other words, the identity system needs to work as both a Twitter button and Facebook page.
You are looking at form, color and alphabet as language, and you should try to figure out what the variables are and at what point is the system no longer recognizable.</p>

<h3 id="Logo Identities">Logo Identities</h3>
<p>Logo identities form part of Brand Identity Systems, which identifies a business or corporation through the use of an icon or mark. That is the task Paula Scher was given in 2014 when she designed the new identity logo for Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>
<img src="images/Picture6.png">

<p>Paula’s logo identity for this design revolves around the word “Art”, in which the “A” has been customized into seventy-two different styles of art and works. The dynamic change from one sculptural “A” to another ensures that the logo is playful and transformative within the limits of the design. The logo feels alive and while Philadelphia Museum of Art has been given a new identity, the audience has been given an interactive and visual plaything. Paula also used a customized version of Avenir, a sans-serif typeface in her design, which brings out a sensible touch on the letter “t” with a curl on the bottom. Simple yet memorable.</p> 
    
<p>Another famous logo identity by Paula Scher is the logo for New York’s Atlantic Theater Company in 2015. Here, the identity is heavily based on the spotlight-like “A” shape that enhances the representation of Atlantic Theater as a whole. In its intense shades of black, blue, red and white, the colour combinations, promotional posters and material give its new identity a powerful impression that is hard to forget.</p>
<img src="images/Picture7.png">    

<p>Paula has been designing for the Public Theater in New York Since 1994 and her first project was to create a new identity for the Theater. Paula knew that the identity had to represent the many people of New York, meaning it had to be big and strong. She got inspiration from American Wood Type, and because of its powerful form, she realised she could make the word “Public” in the same kind of weights as the “R’s”. This would symbolize all of New York because every type of weight was included. The Public design was a huge success and the many designs Paula did for the Public Theatre made her win the Beacon Award of 1996.</p>

<h3 id="Fine Arts">Fine Arts</h3>
<p>Even though most of Paula Scher’s work consists of graphics and typography, she still takes time to paint and illustrate, and her extraordinary map work is a good example of that. As mentioned previously, Paula’s father was a photo-grammetric engineer and inventor but he was also a map maker and invented a measuring device so that maps would be more accurate. This may explain why Paula has been particularly interested in map art.</p>

    <blockquote>“I began painting maps to invent my own complicated narrative about the way I see and feel about the world. I wanted to list what I know about the world from memory, from impressions, from media, and from general information overload. These are paintings of distortions.” – Paula Scher</blockquote>
    
<p>Paula has been painting maps since the 1990s and released her book “Maps” in 2010, with thirty-nine unique paintings in it. The paintings are colourful, typographic descriptions of the world and they are often huge, being well over three and a half meters tall.
I personally find Paula Scher’s map art the most impressive of all her design, not only because they are aesthetically pleasing to look at but because they hold a flood of information based on how each person perceives the media.</p>
    
<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>At 70 years old, Paula Scher is still an active lecturer and graphic designer at Pentagram, where she continues to work on new concepts and projects.
Paula’s extensive work on brand identities, graphic design and map making shows that she has made a substantial contribution to graphic design and typography. 
Especially because a lot of her work that has been accomplished over thirty to forty years ago, is still relevant in today’s society. An example of that is her famous “Public” design for The Theater in 1994, which was a huge success, and still is to this day. She also designed over one hundred and fifty album covers a year. Three examples of those are the <i>“The Ultimate Album Cover Album” (1977 </i> and <i>“Sakura: Japanese Melodies for Flute and Harp” (1978)</i> which are both influenced by Japanese culture and <i>“Bartók” (1978)</i> which is in the classical genre with its Contemporary, Modern and Neo-Romantic style.
In summary, I think these are some of the more significant Paula Scher’s contributions to graphic design because they involve the revival of design styles and historical typefaces in a contemporary context.</p>
